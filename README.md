## About Rack Playground

Rack Playground is a web application that provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for building audio equipment racks. Users can:

- **Experiment** with different gear configurations

Whether you're planning a studio setup, designing a live sound rig, or just exploring audio equipment configurations, Rack Playground makes it easy to visualize and plan your audio gear arrangements.
